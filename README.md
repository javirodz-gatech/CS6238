# Quiz 2 Readings
Hello! I hope everyone's had a good first week. Module 2 is available and the second quiz is open to take this week. Following are the assigned readings for this week: 
1. The Protection of Information in Computer Systems - You should primarily focus on the section that focuses on design principles since that is most relevant to the topic for the week. [I.A.3]
http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/
2. Chapter 5 of Morrie Gasser book

# Quiz 3 Readings 
1. Chapter 5: Intel Architectures Software Developer Manual - I would recommend skimming through Chapter 5 with a focus on sections 5.5 - 5.9

3. Project Zero - Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer bug 
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html
My recommendation is to first read the project zero blog post and then proceed to the paper which offers a more involved reading on the exploit.

# Quiz 5 Readings
Here are the readings for quiz 5. It's really important to understand the lectures and read the recommended readings to do well in this quiz.
1. Password hardening -- you can ignore the details of the math in section 5.4 and 6. But read the rest of the paper, and its details. You will need this for the quiz and the midterm. I cannot stress this enough.
